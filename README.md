# wearable_pusle_monitoring
This was a working prototype project of a wearable pusle monitor system. Remotely monitoring of patients is gradually becoming a part of the healthcare system due to it importance in improving the quality and numbers of patients monitored simultaneously from a remote location. In this project, I have design and implemented a wearable heart rate sensor that can take reading of patients from anywhere in the world. Below were the components used to implement this project:

1. pulse sensor (SEN11574)
2.  ESP8266
3.  Arduino Uno
4.  Jumper wires and broadboard for prototyping

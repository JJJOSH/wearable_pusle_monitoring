# wearable_pusle_monitoring
This is a working prototype project of a wearable pusle monitor system. Remotely monitoring of patients is gradually becoming a part of the healthcare system due to it importance in improving the quality and numbers of patients monitored simultaneously from a remote location. In this project, I have design and implemented a wearable heart rate sensor that can take reading of patients from anywhere in the world. Below were the components used to implement this project:

1. pulse sensor (SEN11574)
2.  ESP8266
3.  Arduino Uno
4.  Jumper wires and broadboard for prototyping

# Pulse sensor (SEN11574) Front and back view
The primary function of the SEN-11574 pulse sensor is to measure heart rate. The precise measurement of heartbeat rate is often a very challenging process, but with the aid of this pulse sensor, it has been much simpler. The finger is placed in front of this pulse sensor, the LED light's reflection changes depending on how much blood is flowing through capillaries at any given time. This implies that the blood volume in capillary capillaries will be high during the heartbeat and low afterward. Therefore, adjusting this volume alters the LED light. The pace of a finger's heartbeat can be detected by this change in LED light. This type of occurrence is referred described as a "photoplethysmogram."

# Arduino Uno

# ESP8266
The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is mainly used for sending the data to a remote location which enable the data to be viewed on a Blynk App.
